# Developer Path Notes

**My Journey in Frontend and Beyond**

Hello! I'm a self-taught developer who's been exploring the world of web development and artificial intelligence. My journey started with frontend development and gradually shifted towards Python and AI Engineering. Here's a brief overview of what I‚Äôve learned so far:

---

## üåê Frontend Development

### HTML & CSS
- Started learning through **Abdelrahman Gamal‚Äôs** YouTube channel.
- Practiced building basic layouts and styling pages.
- Faced moments of confusion by jumping between tutorials ‚Äî but each step taught me something valuable!

### JavaScript
- Took the **JavaScript course by Elzero Web School**.
- Followed additional tutorials from **FreeCodeCamp** and **SuperSimpleDev**.
- Solved many coding challenges to strengthen my logic ‚Äî [Check out the repo]([https://github.com/yourusername/javascript-problem-solving](https://github.com/NauRaa-100/javaScript-problem-solving)).
- Built small interactive games and mini-projects.[Check out the repo](https://github.com/NauRaa-100/javascript-Game) and [Check out the repo](https://github.com/NauRaa-100/tic-tac-toe.Javascript) ...
- Realized I enjoy writing JavaScript and solving problems more than designing UI.

## Algorithms & Databases

- Learned the basics of algorithms and data structures via YouTube.
  - Channels: **KMR Script**, **litprog**, and others.
- Gained a beginner-level understanding of how data flows and how to optimize code.

##  Python & AI Engineering

After a year of exploring frontend, I made a shift toward **Python** and started diving into **AI Engineering**:
- Building a strong foundation in Python programming.
- Currently learning topics like data analysis, machine learning basics, and more. [Check out the repo](https://github.com/NauRaa-100/python-problem-solving)
- Exploring tools and libraries commonly used in AI projects.



##  What's Next?

- I'm still learning and experimenting.
- Most of my projects are *works in progress* ‚Äî I believe in **progress over perfection**.
- I aim to build real-world projects in AI and contribute to open-source.



## Final Note

Thanks for visiting my journey!  
Feel free to check out my repositories and connect with me ‚Äî I'm always open to feedback, collaboration, and learning new things.
